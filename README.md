# 🤖 Gesture Controlled Robot using ESP-NOW | ESP32 + MPU6050

This project is a **Gesture Controlled Robot** developed using **ESP32 microcontrollers** and an **MPU6050 sensor**, communicating wirelessly via **ESP-NOW protocol**. The robot responds to hand gestures to move in different directions, providing an intuitive and contactless control method.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Gesture Controlled Robot is designed to aid **differently-abled individuals** by allowing them to control the movement of a robot or wheelchair using just hand gestures. The transmitter interprets the user's hand motion (yaw, pitch, and roll) and sends corresponding commands to the receiver module wirelessly.

## 🔧 Hardware Components

- ESP32 (x2) – One for transmitter, one for receiver
- MPU6050 – To detect gestures using motion (yaw, pitch, roll)
- Motor Driver Module (L298N or similar)
- DC Motors & Robot Chassis
- Battery Pack (Li-ion/Rechargeable)
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard
- Optional: LEDs, Buzzer (for alerts)

## 📡 Communication Protocol

- **ESP-NOW**: A low-power wireless communication protocol developed by Espressif. It allows the ESP32 boards to exchange data directly without the need for Wi-Fi.

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. The MPU6050 attached to the transmitter ESP32 captures orientation data (yaw, pitch, roll).
2. Based on these readings, the ESP32 determines the gesture (e.g., forward tilt = move forward).
3. The gesture command is sent via ESP-NOW to the receiver ESP32.
4. The receiver decodes the command and controls the motors accordingly to move the robot.

## 🤖 Gesture Mapping

| Gesture | Motion | Robot Action       |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| Tilt forward | Pitch ↓ | Move Forward      |
| Tilt backward | Pitch ↑ | Move Backward     |
| Tilt left | Roll ← | Turn Left         |
| Tilt right | Roll → | Turn Right        |
| Flat/neutral | Stable | Stop              |

## 🔍 Features

- Wireless control using ESP-NOW (no Wi-Fi needed)
- Real-time gesture response
- Compact and portable design
- Useful for robotics learning and assistive tech prototypes
